 HIERARCHY OF OPERATORS:-


 TOTAL TYPES OF OPERATPRS IN C++ : 
 1. UNARY OPERATOR --> ++, --
 2. ARITHMETIIC OPERATOR -->  +,-,*,/,% 
 3. RELATIONAL OPERATOR --> <,>,<=,>=,==,!=
 4. LOGICAL OPERATOR --> && , ||
 5. BITWISE OPERATOR --> &, |, <<, >>, ~, ^
 6. ASSIGNMENT OPERATOR --> =, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=
 7. TERNARY or CONDITIONAL OPERATOR --> ?:
   
    NOTE --> Heiraechy wise --> Relational > Assignment Operator.


 int i = 2 * 3 / 4;
 cout<<i;

 Now to solve above program, According to maths we'll use BODMAS.
 But in BODMAS also the sequence is --> |B|,|O|,|D,M|,|A,S|.

 NOTE:- Modulus (%) is also having same priority as '/' & '*'.
 
 Now in such questions when equal priority is given among operator
 then We go form "LEFT --> RIGHT" According to Computer.

 So here answer will be (2*3)/4 = 6/4 = 1.
 instead of 0 

 A Whole Number is coming due to Integer Datatype.


# BUT if in case of Multiple ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS (=, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=),
we go from RIGHT to Left ( <-- ).


# Also in case of Logical Operator The Heirarchy be like (&&) > (||).
